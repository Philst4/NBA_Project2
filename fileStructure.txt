------


data/: This directory contains subdirectories for raw and processed data. Raw data is stored as received, while processed data is cleaned and transformed for use in model training.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the ML pipeline, allowing for interactive exploration and analysis. These notebooks can serve as documentation for your work.

src/: This is where your source code resides, organized by functionality.

data/: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
features/: Contains scripts for feature engineering.
models/: Includes code for model training and evaluation.
utils/: Common utilities, such as configuration and helper functions.
config/: Configuration files (e.g., YAML files) for storing hyperparameters and other settings.

requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required for your project. It can be generated using pip freeze > requirements.txt.

README.md: Documentation about your project, including how to set it up, usage instructions, and any other relevant information.

main.py: A script to tie everything together. It might load configuration, call functions from src/, and orchestrate the end-to-end pipeline.

src/ (source code):

data/: Code for loading and preprocessing data programmatically. This could include functions and classes for fetching data from APIs, cleaning data, and splitting it into train/test sets.
features/: Code for feature engineering. Functions or classes that transform raw data into feature vectors suitable for model training.
models/: Code for building, training, and evaluating machine learning models. This could include functions or classes for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.
utils/: Common utility functions and configurations that are shared across different parts of the project.
notebooks/ (Jupyter notebooks):

Interactive notebooks for data exploration, visualization, and experimentation. These can serve as a valuable tool for understanding your data, trying out different ideas, and documenting your thought process.
While notebooks are great for exploration, they may not be as modular and reusable as the code in src/. Once you've found effective data processing or model training steps in a notebook, consider moving them to functions or classes in your source code for better organization and maintainability.
